# The Monster Dex
This was a small project when starting to learn react.
It's not using anything fancy it's a basic component with some minor sub components to get things rolling.

This fetches the users from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) and then serves it.
It also uses images from [RoboHash](http://robohash.org)

Using Javascript filtering to just filter down what a user is searching for.
For styles we are using a simple CSS Grid.

The point for this was to be built in a few hours but more to understand the basic concept of react.
